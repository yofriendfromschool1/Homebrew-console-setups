Xbox 360 stores:
[Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/vault/X360-D): (Safe, slow download speeds).
[Myrient (EmuGen)](https://myrient.erista.me/files/No-Intro/Microsoft%20-%20Xbox%20360%20%28Digital%29/): (Fast, requires FTP knowledge).
[Archive.org](https://archive.org/search?query=xbox+360): ( The "Redump" sets).

Step B: The Transfer (FTP)
Don't use USB sticks for everything; it's slow. Use FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

Connect: Connect your Xbox 360 to your router (Ethernet is best).

Aurora: Look at the bottom left of the screen for your IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.50).

PC: Open FileZilla Client (free software).

Login:

Host: Your Xbox IP

User: xbox (could be different check settings then modules then ftp server)

Pass: xbox

Port: 21

Transfer: Drag your game folders from your PC into the Xbox hard drive (HDD1 -> Games).

Step C: The Refresh
On your Xbox, press Start in Aurora.

Go to Content Scanning.

"Scan Now."

Your games will pop up with cover art automatically.

4. XBINS (The "Secret" FTP)
If you are looking for obscure tools, cheats, or older dashboard updates, the "Store" of the Xbox scene is an ancient IRC-based FTP server called XBINS.

It is not user-friendly.

It contains virtually every piece of Xbox 360 software ever released (except retail games).

Most people now just access "Xbins backups" on Archive.org rather than using the complex IRC login.
