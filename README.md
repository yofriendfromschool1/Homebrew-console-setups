Xbox 360 stores:
[Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/vault/X360-D): (Safe, slow download speeds).
[Myrient (EmuGen)](https://myrient.erista.me/files/No-Intro/Microsoft%20-%20Xbox%20360%20%28Digital%29/): (Fast, requires FTP knowledge).
[Archive.org](https://archive.org/search?query=xbox+360): ( The "Redump" sets).

Step B: The Transfer (FTP)
Don't use USB sticks for everything; it's slow. Use FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

Connect: Connect your Xbox 360 to your router (Ethernet is best).

Aurora: Look at the bottom left of the screen for your IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.50).

PC: Open FileZilla Client (free software).

Login:

Host: Your Xbox IP

User: xbox (could be different check settings then modules then ftp server)

Pass: xbox

Port: 21

Transfer: Drag your game folders from your PC into the Xbox hard drive (HDD1 -> Games).

Step C: The Refresh
On your Xbox, press Start in Aurora.

Go to Content Scanning.

"Scan Now."

Your games will pop up with cover art automatically.

4. XBINS (The "Secret" FTP)
If you are looking for obscure tools, cheats, or older dashboard updates, the "Store" of the Xbox scene is an ancient IRC-based FTP server called XBINS.

It is not user-friendly.

It contains virtually every piece of Xbox 360 software ever released (except retail games).

Most people now just access "Xbins backups" on Archive.org rather than using the complex IRC login.

Stealth Servers:
Xbox 360:
1. The Best "Purist" Server: Proto
Cost: Free.

Best For: People who just want to play Call of Duty or Halo online normally with their friends without getting banned.

Why it wins:

Reliability: It is incredibly stable. It rarely goes down.

Safety: It has the best track record for keeping your KV (Keyvault) alive. Some users go 1-2 years without a ban.

The Catch: No Cheating. It disables most mod menus. It also does not spoof Gold. You typically need a legitimate Xbox Game Pass Core (formerly Gold) subscription to play online, just like a retail console.

Website: proto.stealth.sev (usually downloaded via their Discord).

2. The Best "Features" Server: xbGuard or Teapot Live
Cost: Freemium (Free limited mode / Paid VIP for ~$15 lifetime).

Best For: People who want Gold Spoofing (free online multiplayer) and Mod Menus (aimbot, wallhacks, fun menus).

Why they win:

Gold Spoofing: You don't pay Microsoft; you pay the server (or use the free mode) to trick Xbox Live into thinking you have Gold.

"No KV" Mode: Some paid servers offer a mode where you don't even need a valid Keyvault to play, though these are often unstable or limited to specific games.

Customization: They let you change the color of your notifications, guide, and HUD.

3. The "Elite" (Expensive) Option: Cipher
Cost: Expensive (Subscription based or high lifetime cost).

Best For: Hardcore modders who want the absolute lowest ban risk while still cheating.

Verdict: Overkill for most users. Stick to Proto or xbGuard.

Critical Concept: The "KV" (Keyvault)
You need to understand this before you connect.

The KV: This is your console's digital ID card (CPU Key + DVD Key certificates).

The Ban: When you eventually get caught (and you will eventually get caught, even with the best server), Microsoft bans your KV. Your console will be blocked from connecting.

The Fix: You don't buy a new Xbox. You buy a new KV.bin file online (usually $5–$10), put it on your USB stick, and the stealth server swaps your ID card. You are back online in 5 minutes.

My Recommendation for You
Start with Proto.

It is free and forces you to learn how "clean" modding works.

It is less likely to get your fresh Jasper KV banned immediately.

If you decide later you want to use "Gold Spoofing" or cheats, you can switch to xbGuard.

How to Install:

Download the stealth server files (usually Proto.xex and Proto.ini).

Put them on your HDD.

Open DashLaunch on your Xbox.

Go to Plugins -> Plugin 1.

Select the Proto.xex.

Press RB to save to launch.ini.

Reboot. You are now live.

PS3:
Step 2: The "Stealth" Combo (R2 + Triangle)

On the main menu (XMB), hold R2 + Triangle for about 3–5 seconds.

You should see a popup message in the corner: "Syscalls Disabled" or "History Deleted".

What this does: It turns off the "jailbreak" parts of the system and deletes the log files that show you ran unauthorized apps. Your PS3 is now effectively a "Stock" console until you reboot.

Step 3: Sign In & Play

Now you can finally click Sign In to PSN.

Launch your game and play online.

3. Important Rules to Survive
Once you have done the R2 + Triangle combo, your jailbreak is "asleep."

No Homebrew: You cannot open MultiMan, PKGi, or WebMan menus after disabling syscalls. If you try, you will get an error (80010017).

To Change Games: You must Restart the Console. You cannot switch games while online. You have to reboot to re-enable the jailbreak, mount the new game, and do the R2+Triangle combo again.

Don't Cheat: "Disabling Syscalls" hides your firmware, but it does not hide your behavior.

If you use an Aimbot or Mod Menu in Black Ops 2 or GTA V, other players will report you, and you will get banned by the game developers, not Sony.

PS Rewired / PSONE: Revives SOCOM, Warhawk, MotorStorm, and sometimes Killzone 2.

Deus (GTA): Occasionally revives GTA Online (PS3 legacy), but these are often unstable.
